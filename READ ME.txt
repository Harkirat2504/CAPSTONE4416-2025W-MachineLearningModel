Data Loading and Cleaning


The model starts by loading weather data from a CSV file
It first looks for any columns that have too many missing values (more than 5%) and removes them
For any remaining missing values, it fills them using the last known value
It then looks for any extreme values (outliers) and caps them at reasonable limits
All dates are converted to a proper datetime format


Feature Creation


The model creates several types of features to help predict wind speed:

Rolling averages: It looks at the average values over 3-day and 14-day periods
Monthly patterns: It calculates typical values for each month
Daily patterns: It figures out typical values for each day of the year
Percentage changes: It tracks how much values change relative to their averages


These features are created for temperature (max and min) and precipitation


Target Setup


The model sets up what it's trying to predict: wind speeds for the next 7 days
For each day (1 through 7), it creates a separate target column
These targets are just the actual wind speeds shifted forward in time


Training and Testing Approach (Backtesting)


The model uses a "rolling window" approach:

It starts with about 10 years of data (3,650 days)
It trains on this data and then predicts the next 90 days
Then it moves forward 90 days and repeats
This continues until it reaches the end of the data


For each prediction window:

It trains seven separate models (one for each day ahead)
Each model uses the same features but predicts a different day's wind speed




Model Type


The model uses Ridge Regression, which:

Makes predictions based on linear relationships
Includes a penalty for complex relationships (to prevent overfitting)
Is relatively simple and fast to train
Works well with many related features




Evaluation


The model measures its performance using three different metrics:

MAE: Average size of prediction errors
MSE: Average of squared errors (penalizes big mistakes more)
RMSE: Square root of MSE (puts the error back in original units)


It calculates these metrics separately for each day's predictions
All wind speeds can be converted between miles per hour and meters per second


Future Predictions


For actual use, the model:

Takes the most recent data point
Makes predictions for the next 7 days
Returns these predictions in a clear format with dates
